This is a project for [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd001) provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com). 

In this project, I should extract information from several JSON objects and use these information to build a resume dynamically. I was also required to make the resume interactive by visualizeing locations in the resume (with Google Map API) and logging user clicks on the page.

All Web sites, books, forums, blog posts, github repositories etc. that I referred to or used are listed in `references.md`.
